      <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>John Nyangara</strong>founded Nyavalley E-Commerce in 2024 with
        a passion for digital innovation and cultural preservation. His mission
        was to give talented artisans a global platform while making it easier
        for customers to discover and own beautiful, meaningful pieces. John's
        connection to the craft is deeply personal: he is an accomplished
        woodcarver and painter himself, and he works alongside his wife, who is
        a talented jeweler. Their hands-on expertise ensures that quality and
        artistry are at the heart of the Nyavalley collection.
